# ChickenCrossing
2D Platformer created using Pygame module. Utilizes pygamemenu module for custom main menu screen.
This was a fun project to learn some basic game development and bettered my grasp on OOP principles. The
code is a little rough and has some cleaning up to do but still is still functional. 
## Installation
Requires python and module installation using requirements file. \
```pip install -r requirements.txt```
